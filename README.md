# EmPact

## Deployed Site: https://empact.netlify.com/

## Mission Statement

EmPact is about extending empathy through technology to connect people experiencing homelessness to critical information and resources. Our goal is to improve accessibility, increase impact, and empower our users.

## Overview:

EmPact is an application for resources for people experiencing homelessness in New York City. The focus of the design is on accessibility, keeping in mind that users of this app may have physical or mental disabilities, so providing accessibility features such as color considerations for colorblind users and descriptive icons for people who cannot read or do not speak English. The interface is simple and easy to interact with for those who are not proficient with technology. The application is fully responsive and is available for use in libraries on desktop computers, on mobile phones, and on kiosks(tablets) in locations where the rate of homelessness is high.

## Project Initialization

- `yarn install` will pull in all the node_modules you need.
- `yarn start` will start a development server on your `http://localhost:3000`.
- If yarn asks you to select different port with some error message, just select `Y` and it will pull it up on port 3001. This simply means you have a development server up and running on that port already.
